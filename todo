Port existing code to JS

  Port the test data

  Port the generic backtracker

  Port the layout logic

When drawing the layout, we need to do something so that lines which share
edges aren't drawn right on top of each other.

  The basic concept here is that there are numerous "positions" along each
  edge: position 0 lies perfectly along the edge, position 1 is offset a bit in
  one direction, position -1 is offset the same amount in the other direction,
  and so on.

  When drawing a line, greedily consume the available position with the lowest
  absolute value at each edge, and mark that position as no longer available at
  that edge.

  When deciding between two positions with equal absolute value, choose the one
  which matches the sign of the position used for that line at the previous
  edge. If there is no previous edge for that line, choose arbitrarily.
